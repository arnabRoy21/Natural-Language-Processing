With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee.\\xa0'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.\", 'Experts question if  packed out planes are putting passengers at risk .\\nU.S consumer advisory group says minimum space must be stipulated .\\nSafety tests conducted on planes with more leg room than airlines offer .')\n","\n","\n","Second sample from data generator:\n","\n"," (\"A drunk teenage boy had to be rescued by security after jumping into a lions' enclosure at a zoo in western India. Rahul Kumar, 17, clambered over the enclosure fence at the\\xa0Kamla Nehru Zoological Park in Ahmedabad, and began running towards the animals, shouting he would 'kill them'. Mr Kumar explained afterwards that he was drunk and 'thought I'd stand a good chance' against the predators. Next level drunk: Intoxicated Rahul Kumar, 17, climbed into the lions' enclosure at a zoo in Ahmedabad and began running towards the animals shouting 'Today I kill a lion!' Mr Kumar had been sitting near the enclosure when he suddenly made a dash for the lions, surprising zoo security. The intoxicated teenager ran towards the lions, shouting: 'Today I kill a lion or a lion kills me!' A zoo spokesman said: 'Guards had earlier spotted him close to the enclosure but had no idea he was planing to enter it. 'Fortunately, there are eight moats to cross before getting to where the lions usually are and he fell into the second one, allowing guards to catch up with him and take him out. 'We then handed him over to the police.' Brave fool: Fortunately, Mr Kumar  fell into a moat as he ran towards the lions and could be rescued by zoo security staff before reaching the animals (stock image) Kumar later explained: 'I don't really know why I did it. 'I was drunk and thought I'd stand a good chance.' A police spokesman said: 'He has been cautioned and will be sent for psychiatric evaluation.

He was found guilty of causing death by dangerous\n","driving at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday.

The judge agreed with police that he would have been over the\n","limit at the time his red Citroen hit Miss Titley’s blue Daihatsu\n","Cuore on a road near Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, on October 11, 2013.

'Our investigation showed that\n","there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision and sadly\n","it cost her her life. 'Mr Eccleston-Todd had left work in Yarmouth and\n","met with friends at a pub where he drank at least three to four pints\n","of lager. He hadn't long left the pub to return home when the\n","collision occurred at around 9.30pm. 'We weren't able to take breath\n","or blood tests from him immediately and although blood taken several\n","hours after the collision showed he was marginally under the limit, we\n","maintain he would have been over the limit at the time of the\n","collision and in summing up today, the judge agreed. 'The analysis of\n","his phone records showed that he was texting on his phone around the\n","time of the collision so it's highly likely this would also have\n","contributed to his dangerous driving and loss of control.' Eccleston-\n","Todd was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving following\n","a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court (pictured) He added: 'Mr Eccleston-\n","Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel's family have\n","lost her forever. 'I hope this will make people think twice before\n","drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone\n","once they're on the road. 'The dangers of drink driving and driving\n","whilst using a mobile phone are obvious. Those who continue to do so\n","risk spending a substantial time in prison.
